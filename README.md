# Vote Bot

## Usage

```sh
node index.js <site url> <wish id> <number of votes> <use proxy>
```

Example

```
node index.js https://padlet.com/xxx wish-xxx 10 false
```

### Note

The proxy only has 10 free uses, so set it to false if you want to vote more than 10x and take the risk of your ip being logged
